    "A library is a collection of pre-written code with functions so you do not have to write the code yourself. Think of it as a digital library where each of the books in the library is a function. By uploading a library to your JupyterHub notebook, you give your notebook all of the 'knowledge' (functions) in that library so that your code can be simplified. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Pandas** is the library we will be using in Data Circle and is a common library used for data science. If you were in Data 8, you used the Data 8 Library, a simplified version of the Pandas library. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Importing a Library\n",
